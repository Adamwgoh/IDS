G53IDS Finaly Year Project
Supervisor : Andrew French
Image-based corridor mapping and door detection with depth-sensing camera
Aims and Objs : To explore techniques and approaches to detect doorways and wall along a corridor utilizing a short distance depth-sensing RGB camera. The project involve experimenting with plane-fitting algorithms in detecting walls, extraciting doorways form depth data and detecting presence of doors from color data. A GUI will be necessary for users to interact with the system.
